# Pull Request Template Analyzer

## Overview
The "Pull Request Template Analyzer" project aims to empirically evaluate the impact of Pull Request Templates (PRTs) on peer review quality and collaboration among novice software engineering teams. By analyzing the influence of PRTs on the development of soft skills such as effective code review, task management, and communication, this project seeks to bridge a gap in current research and offer insights into enhancing novice developers' integration into the software development industry.

## Introduction
This project builds on the premise that while collaborative tools like GitHub have been acknowledged for fostering teamwork and communication skills, the specific role of PRTs in promoting high-quality peer feedback and efficient collaboration practices remains underexplored. Through a comprehensive study, we aim to understand how PRTs can optimize feedback processes and improve team dynamics, thereby contributing to the broader goal of enhancing software engineering education and industry practices.

## Research Questions
The project focuses on three key research questions:
1. How does the implementation of PRTs influence the perceived quality of peer feedback among novice developers in a project-based software engineering course?
2. How do novice developers describe the impact of PRTs on their commit patterns and version control practices, compared to those without exposure to PRTs?
3. Through novice developers' reflections, does the use of PRTs contribute to more organized and incremental commit behaviors, reflecting a structured approach to collaboration?

## Research Design
The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of PR metadata to evaluate feedback's influence on work patterns and communication dynamics, with qualitative surveys to gather insights into developers' collaboration experiences. By examining both the immediate and longitudinal impacts of PRTs on novice software developers, the project aims to offer actionable insights for optimizing PRTs to improve collaborative learning and soft skill development.
